        <p><em><strong>PC Engineer</strong></em></p>
        <p>I have been working for 3 years in the IT field since I graduated with an associate degree from Green River College. I am currently working as a PC Engineer for WorldWide TechServices. My goals for this field is by the end of this year I
          will have 2 certificates. The first certificate will be Comptia Network plus. The next certificate will be in Security plus. My end goal is to become a Penetration Tester.
        </p><br>
        <p>I am currently teaching myself web developing because I need to know more about how to code websites so in the end I will know where to find the vulnerabilities of a website for penetration testing. This is also I have found just doing web
          development is fun to mess around with. </p><br>
